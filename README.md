# Cooking-Game
A mobile game I developed and experimented with This is a game with the object of creating a dish in a very fast time with simple controls. I had implemented a real time slicing mechanic, where lines are formed in front of an object (fruit or vegetable etcâ€¦) that indicate where to slice the object. And swiping across the object will slice it in the swipe direction and score the accuracy of the cut. Also, I implemented two other mini-games, one for pan flipping and one for oven. I also implemented a way to create levels as data very easily. All of the graphical assets were made by me.

Currently, this is only a demo.
